## 🔥 Problems I Faced & How I Solved Them

This project was not just implementation — it involved real debugging and understanding how OAuth and Supabase work internally.

---

### 1️⃣ Google OAuth – "Unsupported provider: provider is not enabled"

**Problem:**  
When trying to login with Google, Supabase returned:

**Cause:**  
Google provider was not enabled in Supabase Auth settings.

**Solution:**  
- Went to Supabase → Authentication → Providers  
- Enabled Google provider  
- Added Google Client ID and Client Secret  

Lesson learned: OAuth requires configuration on BOTH Google Cloud and Supabase.

### 2️⃣ Google Error 400 – `redirect_uri_mismatch`

**Problem:**  
After enabling Google OAuth, login failed with:
**Cause:**  
The redirect URL configured in Google Cloud did not match the one generated by Supabase.

**Solution:**  
- Copied the exact callback URL from Supabase:
- Added it inside Google Cloud Console → Credentials → OAuth Client → Authorized Redirect URIs

Important detail:
Even a small mismatch (http vs https, missing slash, localhost vs production URL) breaks OAuth.

This taught me how strict OAuth security validation is.

### 3️⃣ Environment Variables Not Loading

**Problem:**  
App was not connecting to Supabase even though keys were correct.

**Cause:**  
`.env.local` file was not configured properly and server needed restart.

**Solution:**
- Created `.env.local`
- Added:

- Restarted dev server (`npm run dev`)

Lesson: Next.js only reads env vars on server start.

### 4️⃣ Row Level Security (RLS) – Users Could See Other Data

**Problem:**  
Initially, bookmarks were not private.

**Cause:**  
Supabase RLS policies were not configured.

**Solution:**  
Enabled RLS and created policies like:

```sql
auth.uid() = user_id

https://your-app.vercel.app/auth/callback
